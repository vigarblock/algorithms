# Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of some of the most popular algorithms. Each algorithm has a simple explanation along with its complexity analysis in its own README file.

**Note** I initiated this project for my own learning and record keeping purposes. Therefore, in most cases, I've implemented these algorithms with my own twist on them. If you do find any particular areas that could be improved, I would most definitely welcome PRs.
